# Row Transposition Chiper
This submission provides two programs coded in python, to encrypt and decrypt messages and chipers based on the concept of Row Transposition Chiper.

## Files associated
```
encryption.py
decryption.py
makefile_encryption
makefile_decryption
```
## Execution Process
Command to execute the encryption algorithm
```
make -f makefile_encryption
```

Command to execute the decryption algorithm
```
make -f makefile_decrytion
```

### Note
Since python execution environment does not require separate compilation and execution steps, there are multiple make files. Python, starts the execution after the command is executed.
